# Secure Spring Boot API with Role-Based Authentication with JWT
# Overview
This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive example of a secure RESTful API built using Spring Boot, fortified with Spring Security for role-based authentication, and powered by JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for robust authorization. The project showcases a well-structured implementation that ensures only validated requests with bearer tokens gain access, thereby enhancing data security and privacy.

# Key Features
Spring Security Integration: Seamlessly incorporates Spring Security to provide advanced security layers for the API endpoints, ensuring protection against unauthorized access and potential threats.


Role-Based Authentication: Demonstrates an intuitive role-based authentication system where access to specific API resources is controlled based on user roles, enhancing fine-grained access control.

JWT Authorization: Implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage authorization, generating and validating tokens for verified users, promoting secure and stateless communication between the client and server.

Token-Based Request Validation: Enforces API request validation through the presence of bearer tokens in request headers, allowing only authenticated users with valid tokens to interact with the API.

Customizable Configuration: Offers a flexible configuration setup that enables easy integration into different Spring Boot projects, with options to customize security settings, token expiration, and more.

Thorough Documentation: Provides detailed documentation and code comments explaining the implementation steps, security considerations, and usage guidelines, making it easier for developers to understand and extend the project.

# Usage
